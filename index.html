		<h2>Biography</h2>

		<p>Piotr Bejnar is a producer, live-performer, DJ, soundman, owner of <a href="http://www.otakerecords.pl">Otake Records</a> and definitely one of the most eccentric figures of the Polish clubbing scene. At sixteen years old, roughly the time of his first club debut, Piotr was fascinated by the mathematical distribution of music. As a live performer, Piotr experiments with various innovative techniques and presenting a generous spectrum of sounds which make his performances a truly unique experience. It is a live improvisation to which Bejnar invites the audience to quite literally generate sounds together with him.</p>

		<p>The idea of playing among the crowd came up accidently. The story goes back to a gig where Bejnar had no space to place his MIDI controller and had to perform with it in his hands throughout the night. Since then, his friends and fans bestowed him with the title of “The Wizard from Korgland”, “ The Unstoppable Korg Rider” and “Modern Talking”.</p>

			<p>The idea has evolved and Piotr continues to change his approach to live sets right up to the night of the party. Sometimes he minimalizes his set-up, holds his sampler in his hands and dances with people on the dance floor. On stage at larger events, he mostly develops his set-up and focuses on the sound, but no one can predict what Piotr's next surprise will be. Often Bejnar continues to play live-acts from his iPhone to control his MIDI remotely, allowing Piotr to enjoy the sound with the audience. This kind of interaction helps build a unique atmosphere, blurring the borders between the artist and the crowd.</p>

		<section class="biography">
			<p>The tipping point in Bejnar’s career was in 2006, when his brilliant way of performing started to become popular in Poland. Two years later Piotr released his first EP "Ty Jesteś Melodyman” ("You Are the Melodyman”) for Canadian record label Open Concept Recordings. In 2010 he created a year-round voice-over season schedule for TVP Kultura and released his second EP "Faces in Water" with Open Concept.</p>

			<p>A year later, after a common gig with Dapayk, he joined Mo's Ferry Production label, where his "Janusz EP" was released. Afterwards, Piotr and Jacek Tworkowski produced an album for Night Drive; "2 Stupid Gods" and in 2012, a second record for Mo's Ferry titled "Cracow Fight” was released. Piotr went on to release a number of remixes, including one for Dapayk & Padberg.</p>
